                                        Within the agriculture sector, we work
                                        closely with a network of smallholder
                                        farmers and young entrepreneurs to
                                        secure essential raw materials for our
                                        production process. To strengthen their
                                        capabilities, FMN continues to invest in
                                        the provision of enabling structures,
                                        particularly in the areas of specialized

                                        these farmers enjoy access to better
                                        inputs, aggregation and storage via our
                                        network of warehouses, collection points
                                        and silos complexes to reduce
                                        post-harvest losses, improve yields and
                                        help distribution.

                                        Better crop yields for the farmers means
                                        that they can now earn more for
                                        themselves, and their families. This is
                                        just one of the many ways that we
                                        positively impact on the general
                                        standard of living in the communities in
                                        which we operate. Our aim is essentially
                                        to promote stronger ties with our
                                        partner farmers, because we know that
